# tobii-controller
This is a port, with some modifications, of a script written by @SogoHiroyuki, to make it easier to use tobiis from psychopy.

The original is located here:

I have taken the Psychopy version of his script and am adapting it to:
- not use Image from PIL
- have a slightly more intuitive calibration procedure
